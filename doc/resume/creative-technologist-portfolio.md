## Projects

**My Friends Are My Power Station** | May 2020
*Parsons School of Design - Thesis Installation*

Created kinetic projection mapping installation exploring urban loneliness using 40+ spinning wire units powered by batteries. Collected intimate relationship statements from 15 interviews and programmed projection to reveal one word per rotation, requiring viewer focus to decode full sentences. Built mechanical-digital hybrid system where traditional materials meet live-stream projection, creating rhythm between flashing moments and continuous narratives. **Impact:** Exhibited at Parsons thesis show, transformed individual stories into shared platform for vulnerability, proving technology can amplify emotional connection in public spaces.

**Interactive Virtual Drum Kit** | Nov 2025
*UTS - Interactive Media Project*

Built browser-based musical instrument using MediaPipe hand tracking, p5.js, and GLSL shaders to transform webcams into performance-ready drum kits. Engineered gesture recognition detecting "punch velocity" to trigger percussion, synchronized with GPU-accelerated shaders creating audio-reactive visuals that shift from teal to orange based on intensity. Implemented no-touch exploration mode for rehearsal without triggering sounds. **Results:** Zero-latency system deployable on any laptop, scalable to installations, remote jam sessions, and music education. Demonstrated fusion of motion tracking and generative visuals as unified artistic medium.

**Design Museum Tour as a Game** | Dec 2019
*Brooklyn Museum, Parsons - Experience Design*

Reimagined museum visit as game-based learning system using Brooklyn Museum's 5-floor architecture as narrative progression framework. Conducted user research to map visitor motivation and designed layered mission system where each floor represents unique interaction chapter. Integrated sensor networks, projection mapping, object recognition, and motion tracking into cohesive journey map from observation to embodied participation. **Impact:** Transformed passive viewing into active play through game logic applied to spatial design. Created embodied learning experience bridging personal discovery and collective meaning. Framework adaptable to cultural institutions prioritizing engagement over passive observation.

**Content-Driven Food Delivery Experience** | 2023
*TikTok Local Life - UX Designer*

Designed "Order First, Then Schedule Delivery" feature bridging content engagement and food delivery. Challenged traditional intent-based ordering by capturing impulse moments through live-stream voucher collection. Aligned 3 cross-functional systems: live content, voucher wallet, delivery flow. A/B tested conversion triggers (push, in-feed cards). **Results:** Improved post-live conversion, repeat rate, significant GMV uplift. Framework reused for beauty and retail verticals.
