### Acting Roles That Showcase Difficulty
If you want to win an acting Oscar, choose a role that lets the performer demonstrate obvious technical skill. Playing a character with a disability is a proven path: think of Christy Brown with cerebral palsy in *My Left Foot* (1989) or Raymond Babbitt on the autism spectrum in *Rain Man* (1988). These performances telegraph the craft involved, signaling prestige to voters.

### Issue-Driven Narratives And The Oscar Voter
Oscar voters also reward films that tackle social issues from a liberal, uplifting angle. Compare *Driving Miss Daisy* and *Do the Right Thing*, both released in 1989. The former won four Oscars, including Best Picture, by presenting race relations in a gentle, conciliatory light. Spike Lee's sharper, more confrontational film secured only two nominations—Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor—despite its later recognition as a modern classic.
