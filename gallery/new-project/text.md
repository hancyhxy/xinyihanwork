### Data Tracking

I identified a new demand among women for athletic wear that integrates with the rhythm of daily life, blending into everyday casual outfits, not just for fitness. Consequently, I set the scenes in representative locations like 'supermarkets,' 'urban street views,' and 'cycling,' capturing leisure-style pairings that blur the lines between sportswear and everyday wear. The post successfully garnered 5,000 interactions.
